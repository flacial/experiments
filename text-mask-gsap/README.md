## CLIP-PATH X GSAP

Experimenting with the clip-path property and GSAP and ScrollTrigger plugin.

### Thoughts

- The clip-path is pretty effective at creating a mask for a text element and revealing it on scroll.
- If the text is too long, it'll be tricky to get the right amount of reveal.
- GSAP is great.
- Gotta remake the office vampire website.
